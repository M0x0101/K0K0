## Challenges 

### [K0K0.apk]()

```
KOKO though his app is the most secure app in the world, but I think any app that doesn’t have thorough checks can be hacked. Could you beat KOKO like I did?

Your challenge: Make a static analysis to understand what K0K0 did in the background, and make android app to exploit K0K0 to obtain the flag.

Note the flag saved at the this version of APP is a dummy flag, 
If you'r exploit app can get it, it should get the right flag from my version 😉. 

What you should send ?
- The exploit for K0K0's app (an apk or code which I just need to copy/paste to an empty Android studio project)

Ahhh.....
 
Good luck !
